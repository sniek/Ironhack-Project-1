# Ironhack Midterm Project

## Functionality

- Links in the menu works on every site (services turns to service section on index.html)
- Made the Website responsive by using flexbox (still needs fine tuning)
- Javascript validation for the Name and Textarea of the contact form
- fetching data in the projects folder (1.html and fetch.js)

## Bonus
- bonus hover animation on the project/service cards
- created a subtle hover effect on the submit buttons

## To Do

- fine tune responsiveness
- fetch data for the project site itself and use it on the actual project.html
